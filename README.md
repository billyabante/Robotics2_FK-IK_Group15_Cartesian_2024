## Il. Degrees of Freedom of Cartesian Manipulator

**Degrees of Freedom (DOF)** - definition

In order to get the DOF of a Cartesian Manipulator, the **_Grubler's Formula_** was used.

## VI. HTM of a Cartesian Manipulator

   **Homogeneous Transformation Matrix (HTM)** is a mathematical construct used in robotics and computer graphics to represent the position and orientation of an object in space. It combines rotation and translation into a single 4x4 matrix, allowing for efficient computations and transformations of points or objects within a coordinate system.

The general form of a homogeneous transformation matrix ( T ) is:

where:
- \( R \) is a 3x3 rotation matrix representing the orientation of the object.
- \( \mathbf{d} \) is a 3x1 translation vector representing the position of the object.
- \( \mathbf{0} \) is a 1x3 zero vector.
- The bottom-right element is always 1, which allows for the matrix to be invertible and used in various transformations.

This matrix can be used to perform operations such as rotating, translating, or scaling objects in a three-dimensional space, and it is particularly useful in the context of robotic manipulators and computer graphics modeling.
